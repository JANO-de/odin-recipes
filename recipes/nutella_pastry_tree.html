        A really easy recipe for Christmas.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry, thawed</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chocolate-hazelnut spread (such as Nutella), or more to taste, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. </li>
        <li>Roll out one puff pastry sheet into a large rectangle on a lightly floured surface and place on the prepared baking sheet. </li>
        <li>Lightly score puff pastry into the shape of a Christmas tree (triangle) with a wide base. Spread chocolate-hazelnut spread over the triangle in a thin layer with the back of a spoon. </li>
        <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, and eggs together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. </li>
        <li>Roll out the second sheet of puff pastry to a large rectangle and place on top of the first one. Carefully trace the shape of the chocolate-covered triangle underneath and cut out the Christmas tree shape and the trunk. Pull away excess pastry. </li>
        <li>Lightly score 2 lines down the middle of the triangle to form a tree trunk that is narrower at the top and gets wider towards the base. Using the trunk as a guide, cut branches into the sides of the triangle. </li>
        <li>Twist the branches away from you, trying to get in 2 turns on the lower branches. Continue moving up the tree, twisting away from you as you go. </li>
        <li>Cut a small star out of the excess pastry; place it on top of the tree. Brush the star and the whole tree with beaten egg. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until puffy and golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Slide onto a serving plate, using a piece of parchment paper if needed. </li>
    </ol>
